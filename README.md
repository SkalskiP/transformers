## 👋 hello

I'm Peter, a software engineer embarking on a fresh journey into the world of 
transformers, and I invite you to join me! The course is a work in progress—it’s free, 
open-source, and we’ll be building it together, step by step. We'll explore key 
concepts, tackle practical exercises, and dissect seminal papers, all while learning 
and growing together. Using YouTube videos for clarity and Jupyter notebooks for 
hands-on practice, we're set for our collaborative journey into the world of 
transformers. Let's dive in together! 🚀

## 🚀 Course program

### 🔑 Key concepts

- Encoder-decoder architecture
- Self-attention
- Multi-head attention
- Positional encoding
- Keys, queries, and values
- Word embeddings
- Dynamic padding
- Tokenization

### 🛠️ Practical exercises

- Implement self-attention from scratch
- Implement multi-head attention from scratch
- Build a simple transformer model for a sequence-to-sequence task
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model like BERT or GPT-2 on a specific task
- Use a pre-trained transformer like GPT-2 for text generation
- Train ViT on custom dataset for image classification
